	abstract = {Testes of most male mammals present the particularity of being externalized from the body and are consequently slightly cooler than core body temperature (4-8°C below). Although, hypothermia of the testis is known to increase germ cells apoptosis, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms, including cold sensors, transduction pathways, and apoptosis triggers. In this study, using a functional knockout mouse model of the cold and menthol receptors, dubbed transient receptor potential melastatine 8 (TRPM8) channels, we found that TRPM8 initiated the cold-shock response by differentially modulating cold- and heat-shock proteins. Besides, apoptosis of germ cells increased in proportion to the cooling level in control mice but was independent of temperature in knockout mice. We also observed that the rate of germ cell death correlated positively with the reactive oxygen species level and negatively with the expression of the detoxifying enzymes. This result suggests that the TRPM8 sensor is a key determinant of germ cell fate under hypothermic stimulation.-Borowiec, A.-S., Sion, B., Chalmel, F., Rolland, A.

In immune cells, it controls fundamental processes such as proliferation, cell adhesion, and migration, while in cancer, SOCE and ORAI1 gene expression are dysregulated and lead to abnormal migration and/or cell proliferation. In the present study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to delete the ORAI1 gene and to identify its role in proliferative and migrative properties of the model cell line HEK-293. We showed that ORAI1 deletion greatly reduced SOCE. Thereby, we found that this decrease and the absence of ORAI1 protein did not affect HEK-293 proliferation. In addition, we determined that ORAI1 suppression did not affect adhesive properties but had a limited impact on HEK-293 migration. Overall, we showed that ORAI1 and SOCE are largely dispensable for cellular proliferation, migration, and cellular adhesion of HEK-293 cells. Thus, despite its importance in providing Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells, our results indicate that the lack of SOCE does not deeply impact HEK-293 cells. This finding suggests the existence of compensatory mechanism enabling the maintenance of their physiological function.},

We therefore carried out experiments to determine whether this protein is expressed in PCA LNCaP cells and in PCA tissues, and whether its expression may be altered during cancer development. In addition, we evaluated the influence on cell proliferation of overexpressing or downregulating this subunit. In vitro experiments show that α2δ2 subunit overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, alterations of calcium homeostasis and the recruitment of a nuclear factor of activated T-cells pathway. Furthermore, we carried out in vivo experiments on immuno-deficient nude mice in order to evaluate the tumorigenic potency of the α2δ2 subunit. We show that α2δ2-overexpressing PCA LNCaP cells are more tumorigenic than control LNCaP cells when injected into nude mice. In addition, gabapentin, a ligand of α2δ2, reduces tumor development in LNCaP xenografts. Finally, we show that the action of α2δ2 on tumor development occurs not only through a stimulation of proliferation, but also through a stimulation of angiogenesis, via an increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in cells overexpressing α2δ2.},

Ensuing withdrawal in abstinent patients manifests itself with severe symptoms, including cold hyperalgesia, often preventing addicted patients from successfully completing the rehabilitation. Unsurprisingly, OPRMs have been a central point of many studies. Nonetheless, a satisfactory understanding of the pathways leading to distorted sensory responses during opiate administration and abstinence is far from complete. Here, we present a mechanism that leads to modulation by OPRMs of one of the sensory responses, thermosensation. Activation of OPRM1 leads to internalization of a cold-sensor TRPM8, which can be reversed by a follow-up treatment with the inverse OPRM agonist naloxone. Knockout of TRPM8 protein leads to a decrease in morphine-induced cold analgesia. The proposed pathway represents a universal mechanism that is probably shared by regulatory pathways modulating general pain sensation in response to opioid treatment.},

	abstract = {Since its cloning a decade ago, TRPM8 channel has emerged as a promising prognostic marker and a putative therapeutic target in prostate cancer (PCa). However, recent studies have brought to light the complexity of TRPM8 isoforms in PCa. Consequently, the respective role of each TRPM8 isoform needs to be deciphered prior to considering TRPM8 as an attractive therapeutic target. Full-length (6 transmembrane (TM)-domain) TRPM8 channel is overexpressed in early PCa and repressed in advanced prostate tumors whereas the localization of the truncated, 4TM-TRPM8 channel (4 transmembrane (TM)-domain), in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is independent of the pathogenic status of epithelial cells. In the same line, expression of non-channel cytoplasmic small TRPM8 isoforms (namely sM8) is conserved in cancer cells. In this study, we identify sM8s as putative regulator of PCa cell death. Indeed, suppression of sM8 isoforms was found to induce concomitantly ER stress, oxidative stress, p21 expression and apoptosis in human epithelial prostate cancer cells. We furthermore demonstrate that induction of such mechanisms required the activity of 4TM-TRPM8 channels at the ER-mitochondria junction. Our study thus suggests that targeting sM8 could be an appropriate strategy to fight prostate cancer.},

Here, we reveal a novel facet of PCa motility control via direct protein-protein interaction (PPI) of the channel with the small GTPase Rap1A. The functional interaction of the two proteins was assessed by active Rap1 pull-down assays and live-cell imaging experiments. Molecular modeling analysis allowed the identification of four putative residues involved in TRPM8-Rap1A interaction. Point mutations of these sites impaired PPI as shown by GST-pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and PLA experiments and revealed their key functional role in the adhesion and migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells. More precisely, TRPM8 inhibits cell migration and adhesion by trapping Rap1A in its GDP-bound inactive form, thus preventing its activation at the plasma membrane. In particular, residues E207 and Y240 in the sequence of TRPM8 and Y32 in that of Rap1A are critical for the interaction between the two proteins not only in PC3 cells but also in cervical (HeLa) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. This study deepens our knowledge of the mechanism through which TRPM8 would exert a protective role in cancer progression and provides new insights into the possible use of TRPM8 as a new therapeutic target in cancer treatment.},

Functional interaction of TCAF1/TRPM8 also leads to a reduction in both the speed and directionality of migration of prostate cancer cells, which is consistent with an observed loss of expression of TCAF1 in metastatic human specimens, whereas TCAF2 promotes migration.

Here, we reveal a novel non-channel function for TRPM8 that unexpectedly acts as a Rap1 GTPase inhibitor, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell motility, independently of pore function. TRPM8 retains Rap1 intracellularly through direct protein-protein interaction, thus preventing its cytoplasm-plasma membrane trafficking. In turn, this mechanism impairs the activation of a major inside-out signaling pathway that triggers the conformational activation of integrin and, consequently, cell adhesion, migration, in vitro endothelial tube formation, and spheroid sprouting. Our results bring to light a novel, pore-independent molecular mechanism by which endogenous TRPM8 expression inhibits Rap1 GTPase and thus plays a critical role in the behavior of vascular endothelial cells by inhibiting migration.},

The latter cells might modify in the TME the impact of RES on tumor cells via secreted factors. Recent data clearly show the impact of CAF on cancer cells apoptosis resistance via secreted factors. However, the effects of RES on PCa CAF have not been studied so far. We have investigated here for the first time the effects of RES on the physiology of PCa CAF in the context of TME. Using a prostate cancer CAF cell line and primary cultures of CAF from prostate cancers, we show that RES activates the N-terminal mutated Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel leading to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration and the expression and secretion of growth factors (HGF and VEGF) without inducing apoptosis in these cells. Interestingly, in the present work, we also show that when the prostate cancer cells were co-cultured with CAF, the RES-induced cancer cell apoptosis was reduced by 40\%, an apoptosis reduction canceled in the presence of the TRPA1 channel inhibitors. The present work highlights CAF TRPA1 ion channels as a target for RES and the importance of the channel in the epithelial-stromal crosstalk in the TME leading to resistance to the RES-induced apoptosis.},

Despite its first discovery in the early 2000s, the role of this channel in prostate cancer (PCa) remained, until now, obscure. Here we show that TRPV6 mediates calcium entry, which is highly increased in PCa due to the remodeling mechanism involving the translocation of the TRPV6 channel to the plasma membrane via the Orai1/TRPC1-mediated Ca(2+)/Annexin I/S100A11 pathway, partially contributing to SOCE. The TRPV6 calcium channel is expressed de novo by the PCa cell to increase its survival by enhancing proliferation and conferring apoptosis resistance. Xenografts in nude mice and bone metastasis models confirmed the remarkable aggressiveness of TRPV6-overexpressing tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of these demonstrated the increased expression of clinical markers such as Ki-67, prostate specific antigen, synaptophysin, CD31, and CD56, which are strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Thus, the TRPV6 channel acquires its oncogenic potential in PCa due to the remodeling mechanism via the Orai1-mediated Ca(2+)/Annexin I/S100A11 pathway.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that ion channels are critically involved in cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of ion signaling promoting cancer behavior are poorly understood and the complexity of the underlying remodeling during metastasis remains to be explored. Here, using a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques, we show that metastatic prostate cancer cells acquire a specific Na+ /Ca2+ signature required for persistent invasion. We identify the Na+ leak channel, NALCN, which is overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer, as a major initiator and regulator of Ca2+ oscillations required for invadopodia formation. Indeed, NALCN-mediated Na+ influx into cancer cells maintains intracellular Ca2+ oscillations via a specific chain of ion transport proteins including plasmalemmal and mitochondrial Na+ /Ca2+ exchangers, SERCA and store-operated channels. This signaling cascade promotes activity of the NACLN-colocalized proto-oncogene Src kinase, actin remodeling and secretion of proteolytic enzymes, thus increasing cancer cell invasive potential and metastatic lesions in vivo. Overall, our findings provide new insights into an ion signaling pathway specific for metastatic cells where NALCN acts as persistent invasion controller.},
